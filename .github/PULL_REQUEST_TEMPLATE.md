# Pull Request Note

I really appreciate your interest in SchemaCrawler. At this point, I am not accepting any pull requests or contributions, since I am trying to figure out copyright and/ or patent issues.

Please feel free to file bug reports and enhancement requests, though, and I will do my best to address them quickly. If you would like to suggest a change and include a patch as a proof-of-concept, that would help me better understand what is needed. However, please do not be offended if I rewrite your patch from scratch.
